 LIMoSim: Lightweight ICT-centric Mobility Simulation
 ========
 ![Logo](misc/img/logo_256.png "LIMoSim")

 **Preliminary Beta Version**

**LIMoSim** is an open source framework for integrated joint simulation of aerial and ground-based vehicular communication networks with an explicit focus on the development of *anticipatory* mobile communication systems. Moreover, it brings together high level mobility simulation with well-known analytical acceleration models.
